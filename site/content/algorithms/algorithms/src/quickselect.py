Quickselect
-----------

Quickselect (also known as Hoare's selection algorithm) is a selection
algorithm to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list of
n elements.

Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element
as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as
less than or greater than the pivot. However, instead of recursing into both
sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the side with
the element it is searching for. This reduces the average complexity from
O(nlog n) to O(n), with a worst case of O(n^2).
