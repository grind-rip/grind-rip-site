title = 'Tree Traversal'
draft = false
description =  '''
Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree exactly once.
Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.
There are two main tree traversals: depth-first and breadth-first search.
Additionally, depth-first search can be done pre-order, post-order, and
in-order.
