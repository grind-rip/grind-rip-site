## 2024-01-11

* Submitted applications to Google:
  * Software Engineer III, Google Cloud Storage (L4)
  * Senior Software Engineer, Google Cloud Storage (L5)

## 2024-01-12

* Contacted by recruiter
* Completed brief questionnaire
* Created this repository (originally it was called *interview-grind*)

In the past, I have done technical interviews in Go. Since Go is a less forgiving language (it is statically typed), I am opting to use Python this time around.

## 2024-01-13

* Called brother

My brother, [Stefan Kraus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-kraus-g), is a Software Engineer (L4) at Google. We talked about the interview process and areas I should focus on. Since he recommended focusing on the Software Engineer III role (as opposed to the Senior Software Engineer role, which has a far more rigorous interview process), my preparation should focus mainly on algorithms and data structures.

* Developed a study plan

Since the L4 (or Software Engineer III) interview is focused mainly on one's ability to solve technical problems, this is where the bulk of my preparation will focus. This includes reviewing *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Y. Bhargava and completing LeetCode problems.

* Read [14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed). My notes on this article can be found [here](/notes).

## 2024-01-14

* Completed [Two Sum](/leetcode/two-sum)

Warmed up with an easy one. It took longer than expected, but, as I've learned, it takes a little bit of time to get the LeetCode *flow* back.

* Completed [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](/leetcode/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)

Another easy one (sliding window). Again, it took longer than expected and I should keep in mind that a sliding window can also look backwards. I was able to quickly find the O(n^2) solution, however, this will not cut it for Google. If ever a solution runs in O(n^2) time, you will probably need to rethink the problem and find a better solution.

After lunch I plan to read through some documentation on the Tech Interview Handbook.

* Read this: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/about
* Read this: https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/faq

## 2024-01-15

* MLK Day. Planning to study for 5-6 hours. Starting by getting organized, then diving into some problems.
* Focusing on dynamic programming today

## 2024-01-16

* Spent over 4 hours studying today. Mostly dynamic programming. Finally getting the gist of how to solve these problems, though I still find the iterative approach (bottom-up approach) difficult to come to intuitively.

## 2024-01-17

* Heavy work day. Only got in 45 minutes of study.

## 2024-01-18

* Wrapped up dynamic programming and completed the following problems:
  * [Climbing Stairs](/leetcode/climbing-stairs)
  * [Coin Change](/leetcode/coin-change)

It looks like Google is moving me forward with the L5 interview. RIP

>Thank you for your response! Our team has reviewed all of your information and
>would like to move forward with next steps, including scheduling an initial
>screening using Google Meet.

Additionally, I was asked to schedule an initial virtual technical screen. This will last 45 minutes and be in Google Docs.

>**Note: You will not have access to an editor or compiler**

## 2024-01-19

* Completed an additional application:
>Employment Application (This form is different from the application you may
>have used to apply to Google and contains a non-disclosure agreement.)

I plan to spend the full day studying heaps and priority queues.

* Completed the following easy problems for fun:
  * [Valid Parentheses](/leetcode/valid-parentheses)
  * [Valid Palindrome](/leetcode/valid-palindrome)

Interview has been scheduled:
* Date: Monday, January 29th, 2024
* Interview Time: 1:00pm - 1:45pm CST

## 2024-01-20

* Starting off with an easy warm-up problem:
  * [Merge Two Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-two-sorted-lists)

*(Fuck, took me 1.5 hours)*

* Scheduled a mock interview with my brother:
  * We did Longest Common Subsequence and Number of Islands

His advice:
* They might ask warm-up questions
* Look into domain specific information (Google Cloud Storage)
* Possibly a system design problem
* Domain specific knowledge

## 2024-01-21

* Feeling a little down–like I am going to fail, like I'm not good enough. I just need to keep pushing through.
* Cleaning up a few tasks from the mock interview I did with Stefan yesterday.

## 2024-01-22

* The Google recruiter reached out:

>I wanted to reach out since your initial screen is confirmed and see how
>you're feeling. :)

Kind of a nice touch. It also cleared up some questions I had regarding the phone screen. It was probably automated.

I really need to finish up the following questions:
* [Longest Common Subsequence](/leetcode/longest-common-subsequence)
* [Longest Increasing Subsequence](/leetcode/longest-increasing-subsequence)
* [Merge Two Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-two-sorted-lists)

## 2024-01-23

* Completed two (relatively) easy ones:
  * [Contains Duplicate](/leetcode/contains-duplicate)
  * [Product of Array Except Self](/leetcode/product-of-array-except-self)

## 2024-01-24

* Completed two (relatively) easy ones:
  * [Reverse a Linked List](/leetcode/reverse-linked-list)
  * [Linked List Cycle](/leetcode/linked-list-cycle)

## 2024-01-25

I submitted my application two weeks ago. So far, I've completed 13 LeetCode problems and spent a bit under 40 hours studying.

## 2024-01-26

* Completed two (relatively) easy ones:
  * [Valid Anagram](/leetcode/valid-anagram)
  * [Group Anagrams](/leetcode/group-anagrams)

## 2024-01-27

* Crunch time. Really need to hit heaps today.

## 2024-01-28

One more day before my interview with Google. Whatever happens, happens. I've been studying consistently for over two weeks. I am still not where I should be in terms of preparedness, but this is just one step in my journey. This process has lit a fire in me to continue to improve my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, the true bedrock of computer programming. I have a year to get as good as possible.

* Bought the following books:
  * *Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition* by Thomas H Cormen, Charles E Leiserson, Ronald L Rivest, Clifford Stein
  * *Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition* by Jon Bentley
  * *Art of Computer Programming* by Donald Knuth

## 2024-01-29

* Today's the day. I put a lot of preparation into this interview–if I fail, iiwii. I'll just study more.

## 2024-01-30

* Took a rest day today to get caught back up with my actual job.

## 2024-01-31

* Same as yesterday.

## 2024-02-01

* As I kinda expected, got that flush today:

>Hi Nick,
>
>I've received your initial screening feedback, and unfortunately the
>recommendation is not to move forward in the hiring process at this time.

I also started a new project: [grind.rip](https://grind.rip)

This project is meant to document my job interview preparation journey. It's meant to be serious, but also a little tongue-in-cheek. Grinding kinda sucks, but it's good for you. Have you ever worked with a Software Engineer who couldn't code worth shit? They probably never had to grind. They probably never spent nights and weekends learning data structures and algorithms. They probably never failed a coding interview because the company they work for *doesn't believe in coding interviews*. Fuck that soft shit.

## 2024-12-24

Back from the dead. After getting flushed from Google, I decided to try to make the most of my situation at Workiva. I worked extremely hard throughout 2024, delivering multiple high-impact projects in order to reach Staff Software Engineer. If I could get recognition for my hard work and dedication, I'd consider staying. For reasons I won't get into–at least right now–my promotion was rejected. In the end, I came to the conclusion that there is just a fundamental misalignment between me and Workiva and that it's time to move on.

* Submitted an application to Netflix:
  * Distributed Systems Engineer (L5) - Compute Abstractions

Back to the grind...

## 2024-12-25

* Completed [Binary Search](/leetcode/binary-search). Rusty, but the muscle memory is still there. Added the algorithm as well: [Binary Search](/algorithms/binary-search).

## 2024-12-26

* Implemented [Breadth-first Search (BFS)](/algorithms/breadth-first-search)

## 2024-12-27

* Implemented [Depth-first Search (DFS)](/algorithms/depth-first-search) and completed [Flood Fill](/leetcode/flood-fill). It was surprisingly easy.

## 2024-12-28

* Basically just got organized. I stopped my interview prep at the end of February 2024, so I'm trying to pick back up from where I left off.

## 2024-12-29

* Damn. I had a lot of unfinished LeetCode problems. What's interesting though, is even after 10 months of zero studying, I'm still much better than when I started back in January 2024. For example, I have a much better intuition around dynamic programming. Case in point, completed [House Robber](/leetcode/house-robber).

## 2024-12-30

* Completed [String Compression](/leetcode/string-compression)

## 2024-12-31

* Picking up steam. I've been rotating between studying ([/docs](/docs)), algorithms ([/algorithms](/algorithms)), and solving LeetCode problems ([/leetcode](/leetcode)). I'll expand on this framework later...

## 2025-01-01

* New year, same grind. Studying [arrays](/docs/arrays.md) (gotta start somewhere).

## 2025-01-02

* Completed the following:
  * [Product of Array Except Self](/leetcode/product-of-array-except-self)
  * LeetCode: [Maximum Subarray](/leetcode/maximum-subarray)
  * Algorithm: [Maximum Subarray](/algorithms/maximum-subarray)

After studying specific topics I reinforce what I've learned by applying the knowledge to related LeetCode problems.

## 2025-01-03

* Studying [strings](/docs/strings.md)

## 2025-01-04

* Grindin' on the weekends again. Started [Reorganize String](/leetcode/reorganize-string), then realized I needed to refresh my knowledge of [heaps](/docs/heaps)...

## 2025-01-05

* More heaps...

## 2025-01-06

* Cleaning up some old LeetCode solutions:
  * [Two Sum](/leetcode/two-sum)
  * [Valid Anagram](/leetcode/valid-anagram)
  * [Valid Palindrome](/leetcode/valid-palindrome)
  * [Valid Parentheses](/leetcode/valid-parentheses)

Updated my resume to make it more ✨*ATS-friendly*✨

## 2025-01-07

* Heavy meetings day.

>I'm just a happy-go-lucky, lobotomized IC doing my little tickets, making no noise and pretending I'm not there.

## 2025-01-08

* Applied to [PushPress](https://www.pushpress.com) (Senior Software Engineer, Core) and [ProsperOps](https://www.prosperops.com) (Senior Software Engineer). I didn't even get a confirmation email from ProsperOps. LMAO. This is probably why:
>**Date Posted**: August 9th, 2024

Shit's stale.

## 2025-01-09

* Studying [trees](/docs/trees.md):
  * [Flood Fill](/leetcode/flood-fill)
  * [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](/leetcode/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)
  * [Same Tree](/leetcode/same-tree)
  * [Invert Binary Tree](/leetcode/invert-binary-tree) ([Bruh, it's not even hard](https://x.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768))

Trees are easy.

Applied to [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com) (Senior Software Engineer, Delivery). I have no intentions of working here, but I need to get some interview reps.

## 2025-01-10

* Even more trees:
  * [Validate Binary Search Tree](/leetcode/validate-binary-search-tree)
  * [Subtree of Another Tree](/leetcode/subtree-of-another-tree)

Damn. **Subtree of Another Tree** was a LeetCode easy and it took me over an hour to get the solution. Confidence at an all-time low.

>Hi Nickolas,

>Thank you so much for applying to Senior Software Engineer, Core at
>PushPress. We truly appreciate the time and effort you put into your

>...

Holy shit, not even a phone screen. That's rough.

## 2025-01-11

* Cleaning up some of my previous solutions.

## 2025-01-12

* Cleaning up some of my previous solutions.

## 2025-01-13

Literally zero return emails apart from the flush from PushPress. What the fuck is up with the job market?

* Applied to the following companies:
  * [Raft](https://teamraft.com) (Senior Software Engineer)
  * [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com) (Senior AI Platform Engineer - NLP | LLM)

Completed [Linked List Cycle](/leetcode/linked-list-cycle)

## 2025-01-14

* Applied to the following companies:
  * [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com) (Software Engineer, Infrastructure & Platform (Senior / Staff))

Got sucked down the rabbit hole of edit distance after looking into Longest Common Subsequence. Implemented [Levenshtein Distance](/algorithms/levenshtein-distance).

## 2025-01-15

Applied to [Ramp](https://ramp.com) (Staff Software Engineer | Backend). Heard about them on a podcast. Why the fuck not?

Finished the algorithm and LeetCode problem for Longest Common Subsequence:
* LeetCode: [Longest Common Subsequence](/leetcode/longest-common-subsequence)
* Algorithm: [Longest Common Subsequence](/algorithms/longest-common-subsequence)

## 2025-01-16

* Cleaning up some of my previous solutions.

This is my workday:
1. Pick up Jira ticket in the morning.
2. Complete ticket before standup.
3. Spend the rest of the day grindin'. Easy bag 😎💰

>"Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome."

## 2025-01-17

* Added my [solutions for the Amazon online assessment](/interviews/amazon) in 2022. I was pretty shit at coding back then. Probably still am. Well maybe less shit. Also, monotone priority queues!? How was I supposed to come up with that?

## 2025-01-18

* Coded up a quick implementation of [merge sort](/algorithms/merge-sort), since it was included in the Amazon OA and I'd been meaning to add it.
* Added my [solutions for the Architect.io technical interview](/interviews/architect-io) in 2022.

## 2025-01-19

* Grinded for 28hr 15min this week. Worked my job for 7hr 15min (including meetings). I spent *literally* 1hr 15min doing actual, ticketed work. Who cares about how much work I actually do, I'm good vibez guy now 😎.
* Fuck. Spent over 4 hours on a recursive and memoization solution to [Longest Increasing Subsequence](/leetcode/longest-increasing-subsequence). Was it worth it? I don't know. The 'tism took over and I couldn't stop working on it until I found a solution.

## 2025-01-20

* Finished adding my [solutions for the Architect.io online assessment](/interviews/architect-io) in 2022.
* It's MLK Day again and I'm back to where I was last year. Grinding.
* Off to a good start. Gotta beat my high score of 28hr 15min from last week.
* Wrote a lot of journal entries...

## 2025-01-21

* Created a YouTube account: https://www.youtube.com/@grind-rip
* Focusing on [linked lists](/docs/linked-lists).
* Taking a different approach this week. Instead of covering the topic for a day, I am going to spend the entire week mastering the topic and completing all the recommended LeetCode problems:
  * [Reverse a Linked List](/leetcode/reverse-linked-list)
  * [Linked List Cycle](/leetcode/linked-list-cycle)
  * [Merge Two Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-two-sorted-lists)
  * [Merge k Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-k-sorted-lists)
  * [Remove Nth Node From End Of List](/leetcode/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)
  * [Reorder List](/leetcode/reorder-list)

## 2025-01-22

* Created a Discord server: https://discord.gg/KgdQCYpZ
* Organized [roadmap.md](/roadmap)
* Working on the following:
  * [Remove Nth Node From End Of List](/leetcode/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)
  * [Reorder List](/leetcode/reorder-list)
  * [Merge k Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-k-sorted-lists)

I decided to do these from easiest to hardest.

## 2025-01-23

* Finalized [roadmap.md](/roadmap).
* Reviewed and removed `notes.md` (this seemed redundant).
* Flushed from Ramp:

>Hi Nickolas,
>
>Thank you for your interest in joining Ramp. We greatly appreciate you considering us in your job search. We've reviewed your application and, unfortunately, will not be moving forward with your candidacy for the Staff Software Engineer | Backend opening.
>
>...

I was going through my notes and found this:
>When prepping for the technical interview, it is important to balance priorities. You should spend probably 50% of your time studying and 50% of your time doing problems. This balance should be complimentary, as studying provides the foundational knowledge for solving problems, and solving problems reinforces what you've learned.

Couldn't agree more.

* Added the following, since it is a prerequisite for [Reorder List](/leetcode/reorder-list):
  * [Middle of the Linked List](/leetcode/middle-of-the-linked-list)

## 2025-01-24

* Feeling good today. Fridays are always good days to grind.
* A man of my word. Completed linked lists.

## 2025-01-25

* 100% done with linked lists...at least for now.
* Created a new repository [grind-rip/data-structures](https://github.com/grind-rip/data-structures)
* Put together my plan for heaps:
  * Review/update documentation: [Heaps](/docs/heaps).
  * Review/update documentation: [Priority Queues](/docs/priority-queues).
  * Implement heap data structure: [Heap](/data-structures/heap).
  * Implement heapsort algorithm: [Heapsort](/algorithms/heapsort).
  * Implement k-way merge algorithm: [k-way Merge](/algorithms/k-way-merge).
  * [Merge k Sorted Lists](/leetcode/merge-k-sorted-lists)
  * [Top K Frequent Elements](/leetcode/top-k-frequent-elements)
  * [Find Median from Data Stream](/leetcode/find-median-from-data-stream)
* I have 23 topics to master. I've completed linked lists, so that makes 22. If I devote a week to each topic, that is 22 weeks, or slightly over 5 months. The key will be not giving up and not getting distracted. By July, I should be a master of data structures and algorithms.

## 2025-01-26

* Starting heaps. Heaps a hard.

## 2025-01-27

* OK, let's implement a heap and heapsort.

## 2025-01-28

* Finished [heapsort algorithm](/algorithms/heapsort).

## 2025-01-29

* Finished [heap data structure](/data-structures/heap).

## 2025-01-30

* Added kth smallest (largest) to **Heaps** section in the roadmap.

## 2025-01-31

* Finished heaps. Whew, lad. Now just need to finish the LeetCode problems.

## 2025-02-01

* First full month of interview grinding complete. 107hr 15min. Dwamn. Gotta try to beat it in Feb., even though I lose 3 days.

## 2025-02-02

* Sunday, 11AM, working through 'Find Median from Data Stream'. First time I've started to feel burnt out.
* Running out of steam. I'll have to finish these tomorrow:
  * [K Closest Points to Origin](leetcode/k-closest-points-to-origin)
  * [Top K Frequent Elements](leetcode/top-k-frequent-elements)
  * [Find Median from Data Stream](leetcode/find-median-from-data-stream)
* I'll finish up with 'Find Median from Data Stream', which is a good primer for trees, which I'll tackle next week.

## 2025-02-03

* Found this interesting research paper while studying heaps:
  * [Min-Max Heaps and Generalized Priority Queues](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~santoro/Reports/MinMaxHeap.pdf)

## 2025-02-04

* 100% done with heaps...at least for now.

>Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.

As of today, I've been studying for 6 weeks.

# 2025-02-05

* Working on tree traversal.

# 2025-02-06

>tfw all you want to do is grind, so you try to churn out some AI slop as fast as possible for your job, but it doesn't work, so you end up having to read documentation and actually learn some shit.

# 2025-02-07

* Got a phone interview with some [dust company](https://www.kingland.com). Beggars... Choosers... all that jazz. Never mind, rescheduled to Monday.

# 2025-02-08

* Added Google interview. The flush that started it all!

# 2025-02-09

* Add Workiva interview. Finished [tree traversal](/algorithms/tree-traversal).

# 2025-02-10

* Phone interview with [Kingland](https://www.kingland.com). TC is ~$150k, base + bonus (LMAO). Also requires 2-3 days in office. I'm just going to go through the interview process for the reps.

# 2025-02-11

* Focusing on doing more LeetCode. I think I've been too theory heavy. Practice how you play!

# 2025-02-12

* Literally grinded all day.

# 2025-02-13

* 'Binary Tree Right Side View' took me 10 minutes. Am I becoming not trash? Nah, still trash, 'Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal' took me over an hour.
* Had a call with a recruiter about an opportunity at [Seek AI](https://www.seek.ai). Also, had an Amazon recruiter reach out. Are the SWE job market Dark Ages over?

# 2025-02-14

* OK, just need to finish 'Tree Operations' and the last three LeetCode problems, then I'm done with trees.

# 2025-02-15

* Why am I doing this?

# 2025-02-16

* Once I hit around 35 hours of studying / work, I totally run out of steam.

# 2025-02-17

* OK, finishing up trees.

# 2025-02-18

* Created a login page for grind.rip... Got a little distracted...
* Completed 'Kth Smallest Element in a BST' in about ten minutes.

# 2025-02-19

* Completed [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](/leetcode/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum) and [Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](/leetcode/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree). Both were pretty hard.

# 2025-02-20

* Took PTO today. Finally finished all my open tasks on my roadmap for trees. Moving on to arrays, then strings...

# 2025-02-21

* I have 20 topics left. Of the 20, I've already started 5 (arrays, strings, searching, sorting, dynamic programming). The major milestones will be graphs and dynamic programming.
* Circling back to arrays. Here is my plan:
  * Review/update the following documentation: [Arrays](/docs/arrays)
  * Review/update the following algorithm: [Maximum Subarray](/algorithms/maximum-subarray)
  * [Two Sum](/leetcode/two-sum)
  * [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](/leetcode/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)
  * [Contains Duplicate](/leetcode/contains-duplicate)
  * [Product of Array Except Self](/leetcode/product-of-array-except-self)
  * [Maximum Subarray](/leetcode/maximum-subarray)
  * [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](/leetcode/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted)
  * [Maximum Product Subarray](/leetcode/maximum-product-subarray)
  * [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](/leetcode/search-in-rotated-sorted-array)
  * [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](/leetcode/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array)
  * [3Sum](/leetcode/3sum)
  * [Container With Most Water](/leetcode/container-with-most-water)
* I should be able to finish all of this by next Friday. It's just arrays.

# 2025-02-22

* Studying every weekend is kinda a drag.

# 2025-02-23

* Around 35 hours of dedicated, focused work per week is about where I tap out.

# 2025-02-24

* Ripping through sliding window.

# 2025-02-25

* SSDD

# 2025-02-26

* I honestly work maybe 1-1.5 hours per day. Absolutely nuts.

# 2025-02-27

* More of the same.

# 2025-02-28

* "Sorry, babe, I can't celebrate your birthday–I have to *Merge Strings Alternately*..."

# 2025-03-01

* February stats: 91 hours of studying.

# 2025-03-02

* Into the rabbit hole: Palindromic Substrings -> Manacher's Algorithm. Why am I doing this? Is it even worth it?
