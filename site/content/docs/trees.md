description =  '''
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by
edges. Each node in a tree can be connected to one or more child nodes
(depending on the type of tree) or no nodes if it is a leaf node. Each node can
be connected to exactly one parentâ€”except for the root node, which has no
parent.
